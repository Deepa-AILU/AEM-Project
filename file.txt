3rd Party API Load/Maintenance:

Directly contact the API provider to inquire about potential load spikes or scheduled maintenance on Mondays and Tuesdays.
Implement robust API monitoring (response times, availability) specifically during those days to gather data.
Network Behavior (Time-Specific):

Utilize network monitoring tools (Wireshark, tcpdump) to capture and analyze network traffic from all three publishers, focusing on the failure windows on Mondays and Tuesdays.
Compare routing, latency, and packet loss between publishers to identify any discrepancies.
Internal Scheduled Processes/Resource Usage:

Thoroughly review all scheduled tasks on the AEM servers and the network for any processes running on Mondays and Tuesdays that might consume excessive resources.
Monitor CPU, memory, and network utilization of all publishers during the affected times to identify resource contention.
